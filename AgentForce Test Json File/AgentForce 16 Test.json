      "question": "Universal Containers wants to implement a customer verification process where sensitive account information can only be accessed after the customer passes identity verification. The agent must enforce this security rule deterministically without allowing the large language model (LLM) to bypass the verification requirement. What should an Agentforce Specialist recommend as the best solution?",
      "options": [
        "Use context variables to store verification status in the messaging session and configure the agent to check these variables through natural language prompts during each sensitive action.",
        "Include detailed verification instructions in the agent's topic instructions explaining when customers should be verified and rely on the LLM to follow these guidelines consistently across all interactions.",
        "Create a custom variable IsCustomerVerified set by a verification action, then apply a conditional filter using the expression IsCustomerVerified equals true to all sensitive data actions, ensuring deterministic access control that the LLM can't alter."

      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Using a custom variable with conditional filters enforces deterministic access control that cannot be overridden by the LLM."

      "question": "Coral Cloud Resorts (CCR) uses Agentforce to assist customers with booking and service issues. CCR wants to implement a triage process so that: High severity requests must be escalated to a human service rep. Lower severity requests should result in creating a support case for the guest. The requirement is to achieve the highest reliability and determinism in the response from the agent. Which approach should an Agentforce Specialist recommend?",
      "options": [
        "Write the triage and routing logic in Topic Instructions using an IF, THEN, ELSE pattern.",
        "Use absolute keywords like \"Always\" and \"Never\" in Topic Instructions to enforce logic.",
        "Create a custom variable severityLevel populated by a Triage action. Add filters so the \"Escalate to human service rep\" action only runs when severityLevel = 'High', and the \"Create Support Case\" action runs only when severityLevel != 'High'."

      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Custom variables with action filters provide deterministic and reliable control over agent behavior."
